Generates a personalized 7-day meal plan based on the user's dietary preferences and health goal.

This tool selects an appropriate meal plan (vegetarian, keto, high-protein, or balanced) 
by matching keywords from the user's dietary input and stores it in the session context. 
It then returns a formatted 7-day schedule tailored to the user's health goal 
(e.g., general health, weight loss, muscle gain).

Note:
    This tool should be called after both dietary_preferences and goal are provided.

Args:
    wrapper (RunContextWrapper[UserSessionContext]): The session context for storing the selected meal plan.
    dietary_preferences (str): User's dietary input (e.g., "balanced", "vegetarian", "keto", "high protein").
    goal (str): User's health goal (e.g., "general health", "weight loss", "muscle gain").

Returns:
    str: A formatted 7-day meal plan as a string with context-aware motivation.
